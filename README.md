Hi/Bonjour/n
I am currently conducting research as part of the LakePulse project, exploring the use of close-range hyperspectral imaging to infer biogeochemical characteristics of sediment cores from lakes across Canada. Within my role at LPA, I am tasked with maintaining and preparing the hyperspectral system, scanning the cores, collecting proxy data, processing raw data, maintaining service data, sharing data, creating data visualizations, and developing machine learning/deep learning techniques. Here is my email address if you like to connect h.ghanbariut@gmail.com.
